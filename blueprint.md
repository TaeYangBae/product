# Project Blueprint: Partnership Inquiry Form Integration

## Overview
This project is a modern web application featuring a theme toggle and a partnership inquiry form powered by Formspree. It leverages modern CSS (Baseline) and follows premium design principles.

## Current Features
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between Light and Dark modes.
- **Modern CSS**: Uses CSS Variables for theming and transition effects.

## Planned Changes: Partnership Inquiry Form
Add a visually appealing, responsive form for receiving partnership inquiries via Formspree.

## Project Status: Completed
The partnership inquiry form has been successfully integrated with the following enhancements:
- **Formspree Integration**: Ready for backend processing (user needs to provide their endpoint).
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Uses `oklch` color space for vibrant, perceptually uniform colors and multi-layered shadows for depth.
- **Full Responsiveness**: Adapts perfectly to mobile and desktop views using container-like constraints and flexible layouts.
- **Theme Awareness**: Seamless transitions between light and dark modes for all form elements.
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and clear labeling for all inputs.

### How to use:
1.  Go to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and create a new form.
2.  Copy your unique endpoint (e.g., `https://formspree.io/f/xoqgjrvv`).
3.  Replace `https://formspree.io/f/your-endpoint` in `index.html` with your endpoint.
