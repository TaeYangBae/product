# Project Blueprint: Partnership Inquiry Form & Comments Integration

## Overview
This project is a modern web application featuring a theme toggle, a partnership inquiry form powered by Formspree, and a community commenting section powered by Disqus. It leverages modern CSS (Baseline) and follows premium design principles.

## Current Features
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between Light and Dark modes.
- **Modern CSS**: Uses CSS Variables for theming and transition effects.
- **Partnership Inquiry Form**: Integrated with Formspree for handling inquiries.
- **Disqus Comments**: A fully functional commenting section at the bottom of the page.

## Project Status: Updated
The application now includes a community engagement layer:
- **Disqus Integration**: Integrated `product-15.disqus.com` for real-time comments.
- **Unified Design**: The comments section is styled to match the contact form's aesthetics, including consistent shadows, borders, and responsiveness.
- **Theme Awareness**: Transitions smoothly between light and dark modes.

### How to use:
1.  **Formspree**: Go to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and replace the endpoint in `index.html` if you want to receive emails to your own account.
2.  **Disqus**: The current implementation uses the `product-15` shortname. You can update the script in `index.html` with your own Disqus shortname if needed.
